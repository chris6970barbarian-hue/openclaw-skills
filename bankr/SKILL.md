# Bankr

Execute crypto trading and DeFi operations using natural language through the Bankr CLI.

## Requirements

Install the Bankr CLI:

```bash
bun install -g @bankr/cli
```

Or with npm:

```bash
npm install -g @bankr/cli
```

## Quick Start

### First-Time Setup

```bash
# Authenticate with Bankr (creates account if needed)
bankr login

# Verify your identity
bankr whoami
```

The `bankr login` command gives you two options:

#### Option A: Open the Bankr dashboard (recommended for new users)

The CLI opens [bankr.bot/api](https://bankr.bot/api) in your browser where you:

1. **Sign up / Sign in** — Enter your email and the one-time passcode (OTP) sent to it
2. **Generate an API key** — Create a key with **Agent API** access enabled
3. **Paste the key** — Copy the `bk_...` key back into the CLI prompt

Creating a new account automatically provisions **EVM wallets** (Base, Ethereum, Polygon, Unichain) and a **Solana wallet** — no manual wallet setup needed.

#### Option B: Paste an existing API key

If you already have an API key, select "Paste an existing Bankr API key" and enter it directly. You can also set it without the interactive flow:

```bash
bankr config set apiKey bk_YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

### Verify Setup

```bash
bankr whoami
bankr prompt "What is my balance?"
```

## CLI Command Reference

### Core Commands

## Core Usage

### Simple Query

For straightforward requests that complete quickly:

```bash
bankr prompt "What is my ETH balance?"
bankr prompt "What's the price of Bitcoin?"
```

The CLI handles the full submit-poll-complete workflow automatically. You can also use the shorthand — any unrecognized command is treated as a prompt:

```bash
bankr What is the price of ETH?
```

### Interactive Prompt

For prompts containing `$` or special characters that the shell would expand:

```bash
# Interactive mode — no shell expansion issues
bankr prompt
# Then type: Buy $50 of ETH on Base

# Or pipe input
echo 'Buy $50 of ETH on Base' | bankr prompt
```

### Manual Job Control

For advanced use or long-running operations:

```bash
# Submit and get job ID
bankr prompt "Buy $100 of ETH"
# → Job submitted: job_abc123

# Check status of a specific job
bankr status job_abc123

# Cancel if needed
bankr cancel job_abc123
```

## LLM Gateway

The [Bankr LLM Gateway](https://docs.bankr.bot/llm-gateway/overview) is a unified API for Claude, Gemini, GPT, and other models. It provides:

- **Multi-provider access** — Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Moonshot AI, and Alibaba through one API
- **Cost tracking** — Full visibility into token usage and costs per request
- **High availability** — Automatic failover between Vertex AI and OpenRouter
- **SDK compatible** — Works with OpenAI and Anthropic SDKs, no code changes needed

**Base URL:** `https://llm.bankr.bot/v1`

### Available Models

| Model | Provider | Best For |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `claude-opus-4.6` | Anthropic | Most capable, advanced reasoning |
| `claude-sonnet-4.5` | Anthropic | Balanced speed and quality |
| `claude-haiku-4.5` | Anthropic | Fast, cost-effective |
| `gemini-3-pro` | Google | Long context (2M tokens) |
| `gemini-3-flash` | Google | High throughput |
| `gemini-2.5-pro` | Google | Long context, multimodal |
| `gemini-2.5-flash` | Google | Speed, high throughput |
| `gpt-5.2` | OpenAI | Advanced reasoning |
| `gpt-5.2-codex` | OpenAI | Code generation |
| `gpt-5-mini` | OpenAI | Fast, economical |
| `gpt-5-nano` | OpenAI | Ultra-fast, lowest cost |
| `kimi-k2.5` | Moonshot AI | Long-context reasoning |
| `qwen3-coder` | Alibaba | Code generation, debugging |

```bash
# Fetch live model list from the gateway
bankr llm models
```

### Credits

```bash
# Check your LLM gateway credit balance
bankr llm credits
```

### OpenClaw Setup

The fastest way to connect OpenClaw to the gateway:

```bash
# Auto-install Bankr provider into ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
bankr llm setup openclaw --install
```

This writes the full provider config (base URL, API key, all models) into your OpenClaw config. To preview without writing:

```bash
bankr llm setup openclaw
```

To use a Bankr model as your default in OpenClaw, add to `openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": {
        "primary": "bankr/claude-sonnet-4.5"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The gateway also supports the Anthropic Messages API format. Change the `api` field in the provider config from `"openai-completions"` to `"anthropic-messages"` for Claude-native features like extended thinking.

### Claude Code

```bash
# Print env vars to add to your shell profile
bankr llm setup claude

# Or launch Claude Code directly through the gateway
bankr llm claude
```

### OpenCode

```bash
# Auto-install Bankr provider into ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json
bankr llm setup opencode --install
```

### Cursor

```bash
# Get step-by-step instructions with your API key
bankr llm setup cursor
```

# Check price
bankr prompt "What's the current price of PEPE?"

# Then trade
bankr prompt "Buy $20 of PEPE on Base"
```

### Portfolio Review

```bash
# Full portfolio
bankr prompt "Show my complete portfolio"

# Chain-specific
bankr prompt "What tokens do I have on Base?"

# Token-specific
bankr prompt "Show my ETH across all chains"
```

### Set Up Automation

```bash
# DCA strategy
bankr prompt "DCA $100 into ETH every week"

# Stop loss protection
bankr prompt "Set stop loss for my ETH at $2,500"

# Limit order
bankr prompt "Buy ETH if price drops to $3,000"
```

### Market Research

```bash
# Price and analysis
bankr prompt "Do technical analysis on ETH"

# Trending tokens
bankr prompt "What tokens are trending on Base?"

# Compare tokens
bankr prompt "Compare ETH vs SOL"
```

## API Workflow

Bankr uses an asynchronous job-based API:

1. **Submit** — Send prompt, get job ID
2. **Poll** — Check status every 2 seconds
3. **Complete** — Process results when done

The `bankr prompt` command handles this automatically. For manual job control, use `bankr status <jobId>` and `bankr cancel <jobId>`.

For details on the API structure, job states, polling strategy, and error handling, see:

**Reference**: [references/api-workflow.md](references/api-workflow.md)

## Error Handling

Common issues and fixes:

- **Authentication errors** → Run `bankr login` or check `bankr whoami`
- **Insufficient balance** → Add funds or reduce amount
- **Token not found** → Verify symbol and chain
- **Transaction reverted** → Check parameters and balances
- **Rate limiting** → Wait and retry

For comprehensive error troubleshooting, setup instructions, and debugging steps, see:

**Reference**: [references/error-handling.md](references/error-handling.md)

## Best Practices

### Security

1. Never share your API key
2. Start with small test amounts
3. Verify addresses before large transfers
4. Use stop losses for leverage trading
5. Double-check transaction details

### Trading

1. Check balance before trades
2. Specify chain for lesser-known tokens
3. Consider gas costs (use Base/Polygon for small amounts)
4. Start small, scale up after testing
5. Use limit orders for better prices

### Automation

1. Test automation with small amounts first
2. Review active orders regularly
3. Set realistic price targets
4. Always use stop loss for leverage
5. Monitor execution and adjust as needed

## Tips for Success

### For New Users

- Start with balance checks and price queries
- Test with $5-10 trades first
- Use Base for lower fees
- Enable trading confirmations initially
- Learn one feature at a time

### For Experienced Users

- Leverage automation for strategies
- Use multiple chains for diversification
- Combine DCA with stop losses
- Explore advanced features (leverage, Polymarket)
- Monitor gas costs across chains

---

**Pro Tip**: The most common issue is not specifying the chain for tokens. When in doubt, always include "on Base" or "on Ethereum" in your prompt.

**Security**: Keep your API key private. Never commit your config file to version control. Only trade amounts you can afford to lose.

**Quick Win**: Start by checking your portfolio (`bankr prompt "Show my portfolio"`) to see what's possible, then try a small $5-10 trade on Base to get familiar with the flow.
